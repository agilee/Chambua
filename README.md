SwiftRiver-Tagger
-----------------
The SwiftRiver Tagger is an API for extracting names of people, organizations and places from text. The API
is powered by Stanford University's Named Entity Recognizer (NER) library - http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml


System Requirements
-------------------
To deploy the API in a production environment, you need the following components:

* Java 1.6 or higher
* Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org) or other servlet container
* Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org) - For managing dependencies and the build process


Using the tagging API
---------------------
The endpoint for the tagging API is `entities.json` This endpoint takes one parameter `text`
which must be UTF-8 encoded and submitted via HTTP POST. The API returns a 405 - Method not allowed
for all requests that are not submitted HTTP POST. By default, the API returns a JSON response. XML and other
output formats are currently not supported.

Below is a sample of the output generated by the API:

	{
		"organization": [
			"Reuters",
			"MRC"
		],
		"person": [
			"Mwai Kibaki",
			"Omar Mwamnwadzi",
			"Adoli",
			"Aggrey Adoli"
		],
		"location": [
			{
				"place_type": "Country",
				"place_name": "Kenya",
				"coordinates":{
					"longitude": 38,
					"latitude": 1
				}
			},
			{
				"place_type": "City",
				"place_name": "Mombasa",
				"coordinates: {
					"longitude": 39.66358947753906,
					"latitude": -4.054659843444824
				}
			}
		]
	}
